In CM1102 I made an online shop with the ability for customers to browse the available goods, view product pages, add to a basket along with view the basket before finally following through with the payment (up until contacting the bank). All of these featurs were added without the use of packages.

I themed the site off Windows XP with added features such as windows that could be closed.
