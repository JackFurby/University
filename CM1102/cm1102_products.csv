"1","Consoles","Nintendo 64","The Nintendo 64 originally code-named ""Project Reality"" and was to be called the Ultra 64. The Nintendo 64 release date, June 23 1996 in Japan and 26 September 1996 in America the same year.

This 64-bit console used cartridges rather than CDs, which were being used in competitors 32-bit consoles. The main competitor of the Nintendo 64 was Sony's Playstation. The Nintendo 64 had many advantages over the other consoles, thanks to Silicon Graphics. There is a huge difference in loading times between a CD and a cartridge. This was one benefit, but then cartridges cannot give the same ""CD-quality"" sound.","120.00","images/products/consoles/Nintendo-64.png"
"2","Consoles","Atari-2600","The Atari-2600 launched in Europe in 1978. It originally was known as the Atari VCS (Video Computer System), the console was re-branded when it was replaced by the Atari-5200. The Atari-2600 brought the thrills of arcade gaming into the living room, and was one of the first and best machines to do so.","80.00","images/products/consoles/Atari-2600.png"
"3","CPUs","Intel Pentium Pro","The Pentium Pro is a sixth-generation x86 microprocessor by Intel. It was introduced in November 1, 1995. It introduced the P6 micro architecture and was originally intended to replace the original Pentium in a full range of applications. The Pentium Pro contained 5.5 million transistors. Later, it was reduced to a more narrow role as a server and high-end desktop processor and was used in supercomputers like ASCI Red, the first computer to reach the teraFLOPS performance mark. The Pentium Pro was capable of both dual and quad processor configurations. It only came in one form factor, the relatively large rectangular Socket 8.","70.00","images/products/CPU/Intel-Pent_Pro.png"

"5","CPUs","Intel 4004","The Intel 4004 is a 4-bit central processing unit released by Intel Corporation in 1971. The 4004 is history's first monolithic CPU, fully integrated in one small chip. This was only possible because of the introduction a new silicon gate technology which allowed twice the number of random-logic transistors and an increase in speed by a factor of five compared to older technology. This CPU contains 2300 transistors, runs at 740 kHz and has a 16 pin Package.","719.99","images/products/CPU/Intel-4004.png"
