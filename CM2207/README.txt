This is a program to represent deterministic finite automata. It takes input txt file(s) and will apply various operations on them. These are:

Q1 - output the complement of any input DFA
Q2 - output the intersection of any 2 DFAs
Q3 - output the symmetric difference of any 2 DFAs
Q4 - output an accepted input string of a given DFA (output will be 'e' if empty)
Q5 - work out if 2 DFAs are equivalent or not equivalent

I received 100% for this coursework.

To run the program the java files will need to be compiled. Once done the following commands can be run for each question with the text files in place of fileName.

Q1. java q1 <fileName>
Q2. java q2 <fileName> <fileName>
Q3. java q3 <fileName> <fileName>
Q4. java q4 <fileName>
Q5. java q5 <fileName> <fileName>
